Protocol that's an EventDataFloader
method: loadData (betweenDates: startDate and EndDate)

in the future -> eventKit (checkout eventKit APIs to see what their functions are like)

Currently: just the hardcoded dictionary

viewDidLoad -> set property to dataLoader.getData()

now it's testable (create VC, call viewDidLoad, ensure data is what you expect)



dataSource has a property that's your actual data. Like IGListKit


Keep both table and collectionView delegates in the ViewController.
